The COVID-19 Struggle is an educational game aimed at students who are currently 
re-locating to University in Boston. Players will learn about the most important 
regulations having to do with quarantine and mask-wearing in an entertaining and playful manner. 
All probabilities used in the game are derived from guidelines of the State of 
Massachusetts or the CDC. To make the game more fun several random 
choices have been used, to provide a more dynamic gameflow. 

Functionality Bug: 
University choice and name can only be reset by re-starting the game. This 
is intentional, but some players might prefer to change their university choice eventually. Could be fixed 
in another version by placing the uni_choice in the first stage.
